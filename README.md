### Deep learning driven music generation

[**Songbird**](http://songbird.ai) is a platform for deep learning driven music generation. In popular terms, Songbird is an artificial intelligence (AI) which learns and writes music. In other words, it's an artificial "songbird."

Songbird inherits the legacy of [deepjazz](http://deepjazz.io), an early prototype built by our project lead. To achieve human-like musicality, we apply a variety of computational techniques informed by neuroscience and music theory.
